## Practical notes from OpenViking blog case studies

For the full review trail and tradeoffs, read the case studies:
[`docs/case-studies/openviking-context-post.md`](docs/case-studies/openviking-context-post.md) and
[`docs/case-studies/openviking-context-architecture-post.md`](docs/case-studies/openviking-context-architecture-post.md).
For blog-wide mobile/PWA polish, also read
[`docs/case-studies/mobile-pwa-polish.md`](docs/case-studies/mobile-pwa-polish.md).

1. Build for two readers: the HTML page is for humans, while `/post/<slug>/llm.txt` is for agents. Keep `llm.txt` clean, source-like, and English-only when requested; expose it through page metadata and `/llms.txt`, not through visible helper copy.
2. Let the article structure drive the TOC. Use `H2` for major sections, `H3` for TOC-level blocks, and `H4` inside cards/panels. Do not add TOC index numbers. Folding is opt-in via `TOC foldable`; default should stay expanded.
3. Prefer visible, scrollable presentation over hidden click-to-reveal panels. Tabs and chips should focus attention, not duplicate a working TOC or become the only way to discover content.
4. Treat covers as editorial signals, not diagrams. For OpenViking architecture posts, prefer airy watercolor on cream paper with generous negative space, subtle OV logo hints, warm gold/sage/graphite palettes, and no literal keys, locks, oversized logos, dense diagrams, or blue/purple-dominant branding. Keep high-res imagery for post hero/OG, and provide a lighter `cardCover` for index cards when the source image is large.
5. Respect the post language end to end. Switching language must update body, shell-adjacent UI such as TOC, dates, and labels without requiring refresh.
6. For Lark-derived posts, keep source provenance in authoring notes or internal review docs. Add it to public metadata only when the source URL is safe for public readers. Validate custom component states in generated HTML; small CSS details like inline progress fills can break visible UI.
7. For phone-view polish, use screenshots as the source of truth. Keep the first viewport content-first, collapse dense controls to one line by default, use real short mobile labels instead of clipped text, and add PWA icons/manifest without a service worker unless offline caching is explicitly wanted.
8. Public Lark-derived posts need a publication-safety pass across every surface: zh HTML, en HTML, post `llm.txt`, generated page metadata, and site `/llms.txt`. Do not expose private Lark wiki URLs, internal domains, internal proxies, employee/speaker rosters, private home paths, or internal deployment/community instructions unless the user explicitly says that material is public. Prefer GitHub, `docs.openviking.ai`, and public discussion links for follow-up detail.
9. Keep zh, en, and `llm.txt` content aligned. The agent-readable markdown can be plainer than the human page, but it must not contain extra internal details or source-only sections that the public zh/en article intentionally removed. If the human post uses a public-facing summary table, make `llm.txt` use the same public boundary.
10. When converting a private or source document into a public blog post, write the HTML as the final article, not as commentary about the source. Readers cannot see the original document. Draft Chinese first for direct public prose, remove roundabout framing such as "the point is not..." review notes, then align English and `llm.txt` to that public version.

## What you are building

A single blog post lives in **`src/posts/<slug>/`**. The shell discovers it via a JS-side registry. To add a post you write one file:

```
src/posts/my-essay/index.jsx
```

The shell renders it inside a themed Article container, supplies it with the active language and theme, generates the table of contents from your headings, fills the byline from your meta, and wires routing automatically.

Posts **must not**:

- Import their own CSS, fonts, or theme styles. Theming is global; posts only compose primitives.
- Hard-code colors, fonts, or pixel values. Use the primitives below; they pick up `--th-*` tokens.
- Branch visuals on `theme`. The point of theming is that posts don't care.
- Fetch from the network at render time. Embed everything you need (SVGs, JSON) in `src/posts/<slug>/`.

---

## File layout

```
src/posts/<slug>/
  index.jsx          # required — default export registers the post
  assets/            # optional — local images/SVGs for this post
    figure-1.svg
```

Use the **slug** as the URL segment (`#/post/<slug>`). It must be lowercase-kebab-case, stable for the life of the post (treat it like a URL primary key — never rename), and unique across the site.

For shared assets (covers reused across posts, author avatars), add them under `public/assets/`:

```
public/assets/
  covers/<name>.svg
  avatars/<name>.svg
```

---

## The registration contract

Every post file is an ES module that default-exports a registration object:

```jsx
/* src/posts/my-essay/index.jsx */
import React from 'react';
import { Article, Lead, P, H2 } from '../../blog-components';

const MyEssay = ({ t }) => (
  <Article>
    <Lead>{t({ en: 'A short essay.', zh: '一篇短文。' })}</Lead>
    <P>{t({ en: 'Body text.', zh: '正文。' })}</P>
  </Article>
);

export default {
  id: 'my-essay',
  Component: MyEssay,
  meta: { /* see schema below */ },
};
```

After writing the file, **add an import and register call in `src/posts/index.js`**:

```js
import myEssay from './my-essay/index.jsx';
// add to the array:
[..., myEssay].forEach(registerPost);
```

---

## Writing process

Write bilingual content in this order:

1. **Scaffold the post first.** Map the source into the thesis, H2 sections, key examples, metadata, cover, and `llm.txt` path before polishing individual paragraphs.
2. **Write the English version first.** Get the structure, examples, and technical content right. For long architecture posts, make the first pass a coherent frame, not the final density target.
3. **Run a second filling pass.** Use parallel agents when allowed: one for source/content gaps, one for frontend rendering blocks, and one for terminology/translation QA. Integrate their work into one coherent article instead of pasting isolated panels.
4. **Translate to Chinese after the structure stabilizes.** Produce a faithful translation, including custom component labels, local nav, tables, captions, and interactive states.
5. **Optimize the Chinese version for natural tone.** Follow the [shuorenhua](https://github.com/MrGeDiao/shuorenhua) guidelines: no AI filler, no template openers/closers ("In this article we will explore..."), no empty adjectives. Write like you're explaining to a colleague, not writing a press release.

## Meta schema

Every field is required unless marked optional. Strings that face the reader **must** be locale objects (`{ en, zh }`) unless this post truly only ships in one language.

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | `{ en, zh, ... }` | yes | Plain text. The shell renders it. |
| `description` | `{ en, zh, ... }` | yes | One sentence. Shown on the index card and below the post title. |
| `cover` | `string` | yes | Path to an SVG/PNG. Aspect ratio 16:9 or 16:7 is best. |
| `publishedAt` | `'YYYY-MM-DD'` | yes | ISO date. Drives ordering. |
| `updatedAt` | `'YYYY-MM-DD'` | optional | Render only when meaningfully different from `publishedAt`. |
| `readingTime` | `number` (minutes) | yes | Round to nearest minute. ~250 words/min for prose, less for reference. |
| `category` | `{ en, zh, ... }` | optional | Single short label, e.g. `{ en: 'Engineering', zh: '工程' }`. |
| `tags` | `string[]` | yes | Lowercase, ASCII, kebab-case. Reuse existing tags before inventing one. |
| `languages` | `string[]` | yes | Locale codes the post supports, e.g. `['en', 'zh']`. The shell shows a fallback notice when the reader's lang is missing. |
| `authors` | `Author[]` | yes | At least one. See below. |

`Author`:

| Field | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `string` | yes |
| `github` | `string` (handle, no URL) | optional, recommended |
| `avatar` | `string` (path) | optional |
| `role` | `{ en, zh, ... }` | optional |

---

## Component contract

The shell calls your component with these props (also available via the `useBlog` hook):

| Prop | Type | What |
|---|---|---|
| `lang` | string | Active locale, narrowed to one your post supports (driven by `meta.languages`). |
| `theme` | string | Active theme id. Do not branch visuals on it. |
| `t` | `(value) => string` | Locale picker. `t({ en: 'A', zh: '甲' })` → `'A'` or `'甲'`. Pass through plain strings unchanged. |
| `formatDate` | `(iso) => string` | Locale-formatted date. |
| `navigate` | `(href) => void` | Programmatic router. `navigate('#/post/other-slug')`. |

Hooks (use anywhere inside your component tree):

```jsx
const { lang, theme, t, formatDate, navigate } = useBlog();
```

**Authoring rule:** wrap every reader-facing string in `t({...})`, even if you only ship one language today.

## Primitives — your toolbox

Import from `../../blog-components`. Themed via `themes.css`.

**Structure** — `Article` (root, required), `Section`, `Spacer h="sm|md|lg|xl"`, `Hr`, `Hr ornament`.

**Headings** — `H1` (rare; the shell renders the post title already), `H2`, `H3`, `H4`. Auto-id from text — that is what feeds the TOC.

**Text** — `P`, `P dropCap`, `Lead`, `Small`, `Strong`, `Em`, `InlineCode`, `Kbd`, `Mark`.

**Links** — `A href` (auto-detects internal `#/...` vs external `https://...`).

**Lists** — `Ul`, `Ul marker="check"`, `Ol`, `Li`, `Dl`/`Dt`/`Dd`.

**Code** — `Pre lang="js" filename="...">{...}</Pre>`.

**Quotes** — `Quote cite="..."` for block quotes; `Pull` for pull quotes (use sparingly — one or two per post).

**Figures** — `Figure src caption credit size="sm|md|lg" frame="plain|frame|bleed"`.

**Callouts** — `Callout type="note|tip|warn|info|quote"`.

**Aside** — `Aside`. A subtle margin-note style.

**Tables** — `Table headers={[...]} rows={[[...], [...]]} caption={...}`.

**Layout** — `Cols count={2|3}` with `Col` children. Collapses to one column on mobile.

**Tags** — `Tag` for inline tags.

---

## Custom components

Posts can define custom React components inside their own `index.jsx` for interactive or visual elements beyond the primitives (diagrams, badges, step indicators, etc.). Keep them scoped to the post file. Use `var(--th-*)` tokens for colors so they work across all themes.

If the same custom component appears in three or more posts, lift it into `blog-components.jsx`.

---

## House style — content rules

- **One thesis per post.** If you have two, write two posts.
- **Lead first.** A `Lead` paragraph before any heading. Treat it as the dek.
- **Sections, not headers.** `H2` introduces a section. If you only have one section, you don't need any H2s.
- **No filler.** Don't pad with statistics, icons, or "in this post you will learn..." preambles. Don't summarize what the post is about; just write it.
- **Pull quotes are a budget.** Maximum 2 per post.
- **Code blocks are real code.** No `// ...` ellipsis hand-waving in the middle of an example.
- **Translation parity.** Both languages should say the same thing, not just be word-for-word equivalents. Idioms travel.
- **Cover images** must work at any aspect ratio from 16:7 (post header) to 16:10 (index card) to 4:3 (Garden theme card). Test in at least two themes.
